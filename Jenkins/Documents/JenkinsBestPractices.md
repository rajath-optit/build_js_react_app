# **Best Practices**

## **Security**
- **Check User Authentication:** Can users only access Jenkins with a valid username and password?
- **Review Authorization:** Do users only have access to the jobs and resources they need?

## **Project Organization**
- **Review Folder Structure:** Is your Jenkins server organized with folders for different projects or types of jobs?
- **Consider Multibranch Pipelines:** If you have multiple branches in your version control system, explore using multibranch pipelines for efficiency.

## **Credentials**
- **Look for Credential Usage:** Are credentials stored within Jenkins pipelines themselves, or are they managed securely using Jenkins credentials?

## **Backups**
- **Verify Backup Process:** Is there a documented process for regularly backing up your Jenkins Home directory?

## **Job Naming**
- **Review Job Names:** Are job names clear, concise, and easy to understand?

## **Pipelines**
- **Check Pipeline Syntax:** For declarative pipelines, use the Jenkins Linter plugin to validate syntax and identify potential issues.
- **Review Pipeline Complexity:** Are pipelines written in complex Groovy code? If possible, explore simplifying them using declarative syntax or shared libraries.

## **Resource Management**
- **Check Resource Allocation:** Are there any jobs configured to use excessive resources on your Jenkins server?

## **Monitoring and Cleanup**
- **Review Monitoring Tools:** Are you using plugins to monitor the health and performance of your Jenkins pipelines?
- **Check Build Retention:** Do you have a strategy for cleaning up old builds to avoid filling up disk space?
